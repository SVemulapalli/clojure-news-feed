# Another News Feed Microservice in Scala

Like feed2, this microservice implements the news feed requirements in Scala. This time, using type classes and
[scalatra](http://scalatra.org/) instead of the Cake Pattern and Finatra.

## Overview

The API and model packages of the server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) project.

## Building the Project

This is how you can build the project.

```bash
export TEST_MODE=true
sbt
compile
test
assembly
exit
docker build -t feed6:1.0 .
```

## Running the Microservice

The best approach here is most likely using Kubernetes

```bash
cd ../k8s
kubectl create -f feed6-deployment.yaml
```

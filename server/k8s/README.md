# running on Kubernetes

Introduction on how to run the news feed service in Kubernetes.

## minikube

For developer purposes, I am using [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) on a CentOS 7 laptop. The commands to start up minikube may be different for you.

```shell
minikube start --vm-driver=kvm2
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

### setting up the dependencies

I have written some scripts and configuration files to get the dependent services running. 

#### starting up the cluster

The setup script should work on any Kubernetes cluster. Alternatively, you can provide a use_cluster_ip parameter if you do not want to use the kube-dns cabality. You have to run this scipt only once (unless you delete services and deployments). 

```shell
cd clojure-news-feed/server/k8s
./setup.sh
```

#### initializing the dependent services

You have two alternatives here. You can either run a kubernetes job or a minikube specific script. Here is the kubernetes job. You need to perform this step every time you start up minikube.

```shell
kubectl create -f init-cluster.yaml
```

Here is the minikube specific script approach. You will need to have installed minikube, kubectl, mysql and cqlsh and that they are available in your $PATH environment. You may need to wait a few minutes after starting minikube before you run that initMinikube.sh script.

```shell
./initMinikube.sh
```

### building the service

Right now, these assets are specific to the Node.js version of the news feed. That is because I could never get kafka to work in minikube and that is the only version that doesn't connect to Kafka anyway. Here is how to build a docker image for that version.

```shell
cd ../feed4
docker build -t feed4:1.0 .
```

### running the service

Note that the feed-deployment.yaml file is generated by the setup.sh script and deploys what we just built. 

```shell
cd ../k8s
kubectl create -f feed-service.yaml
kubectl create -f feed-deployment.yaml
```
### testing the service

This is also minikube specific.

```shell
FEED_URL=$(minikube service feed --url)

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"testing dropwizard"}' ${FEED_URL}/participant/new

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"testing minikube"}' ${FEED_URL}/participant/new

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"from":1,"to":2}' ${FEED_URL}/friends/new

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"from":1,"subject":"testing for dropwizard","story":"Kubernetes rocks!"}' ${FEED_URL}/outbound/new

curl ${FEED_URL}/inbound/2

curl -X POST -g "${FEED_URL}/outbound/search?keywords=kubernetes"
```

Alternatively, you can also run the testMinikube.sh to perform the automated version of this test. This script runs the load test app in integration test mode so you will need to have built what is in the client/load project.

### Optional Kong Integration

While it is not neccessary to use the open source API Gateway software [Kong](https://getkong.org), it can be very helpful especially if you want to measure performance without Kafka. 

#### Build the Kong-Logger service and the load test job

Currently, the deployment configurations point to these images on my [Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com/r/gengstrand) so you don't really need to build these locally. If you wanted to modify what these do, then you will need to build the images and modify the deployment configurations to reference the local docker repository.

```shell
cd clojure-news-feed/client/perf4
mvn package
docker build -t kong-logger:1.0 .
cd ../load
lein uberjar
docker build -t load:1.0 .
```

#### Launch Kong, Kong Logger, and the load test job

```shell
cd clojure-news-feed/server/k8s
kubectl create -f kong-logger-service.yaml
kubectl create -f kong_service.yaml
kubectl create -f kong_migration_cassandra.yaml
# run this next line until the kong-migration job is successful
kubectl get jobs
kubectl create -f kong_cassandra.yaml
kubectl create -f kong-logger-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f load_test.yaml 
```

After that, you should be able to reach the feed service via Kong this way.

```shell
FEED_URL=$(minikube service kong-proxy --url | head -n 1)
```

Be advised that, after running the load test, my minikube cluster is pretty much maxed out. I actually have to delete the load test job before launching kibana.

#### Launch Kibana

```shell
kubectl create -f kibana-service.yaml 
kubectl create -f kibana-deployment.yaml
```

If you call the news feed APIs with the kong-proxy URL, then you will be able to track performance by pointing your web browser to the kibana-logger URL.

## Google Kubernetes Engine

I created a project called feed and a cluster called feed-test using 7 n1-standard-4 instances through Kubernetes Engine part of the the Google Cloud Platform dashboard. Then I ran the following in the gcloud console.

```
gcloud config set project feed-193503
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
gcloud container clusters get-credentials feed-test --zone us-central1-a --project feed-193503
git clone https://github.com/gengstrand/clojure-news-feed.git
cd clojure-news-feed/server/k8s
kubectl create -f cassandra-service.yaml
kubectl create -f redis-service.yaml
kubectl create -f mysql-service.yaml
kubectl create -f elasticsearch-service.yaml
kubectl create -f cassandra-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f redis-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f mysql-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f elasticsearch-deployment.yaml
# run this next line until all of the pods are running
kubectl get pods
kubectl create -f init-cluster.yaml
# run this next line until the init-cluster job is successful
kubectl get jobs
kubectl create -f feed-service.yaml
kubectl create -f feed-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f kong-logger-service.yaml
kubectl create -f kong_service.yaml
kubectl create -f kong_migration_cassandra.yaml
# run this next line until the kong-migration job is successful
kubectl get jobs
kubectl create -f kong_cassandra.yaml
kubectl create -f kong-logger-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f kibana-service.yaml 
kubectl create -f kibana-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f load_test.yaml
```

Once I collected the data, I cleaned up everything before deleting the cluster.

```
kubectl delete job init-cluster
kubectl delete job kong-migration
kubectl delete job load-test
kubectl delete deployment kibana-logger
kubectl delete deployment kong-logger
kubectl delete deployment kong-proxy
kubectl delete deployment feed
kubectl delete deployment elasticsearch
kubectl delete deployment redis
kubectl delete deployment mysql
kubectl delete deployment cassandra
kubectl delete service cassandra
kubectl delete service elasticsearch
kubectl delete service feed
kubectl delete service kibana-logger
kubectl delete service kong-logger
kubectl delete service kong-proxy
kubectl delete service mysql
kubectl delete service redis
```

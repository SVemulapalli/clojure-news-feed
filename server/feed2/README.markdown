## sample news feed written in scala

Right now, this is an incomplete work in progress but eventually this will be 
identical in functionality to https://github.com/gengstrand/clojure-news-feed/tree/master/server/feed but written in scala instead of clojure.

This is a micro-service that uses spray so see https://github.com/spray/spray-template as an introduction to that.

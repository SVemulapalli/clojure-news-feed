# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This is an example of building a node.js server.

This example uses the [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) framework.  To see how to make this your own, look here:

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
export MYSQL_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export MYSQL_USER="feed"
export MYSQL_PASS="feed"
export MYSQL_DB="feed"
export NOSQL_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export REDIS_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export SEARCH_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export SEARCH_PATH="/feed/stories"
export NODE_DEBUG=feed

npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:{{serverPort}}/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

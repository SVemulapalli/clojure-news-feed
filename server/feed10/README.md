# graphql version of news feed 

This time, I am exploring [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) by implementing the news feed on [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which allows you to write your code in typescript which runs on node.js

## Status

I am just starting this microservice so there is a long way to go before it acutally works.

## Initial Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Debugging

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running the service locally

```bash
npm run start
```

## Contributing

The GraphQL boilerplates are maintained by the GraphQL community, with official support from the [Apollo](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com) & [Graphcool](https://blog.graph.cool/) teams.

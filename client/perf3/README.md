# perf3

This scala application consumes the stream of performance messages from the feed topic in kafka (produced by the feed service), collects those messages on a per entity and operation basis then aggregates them as per minute throughput, mean, median, and 95th percentile metrics then publishes them to elastic search in a kibana friendly way.

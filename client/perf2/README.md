# perf2

This perf project is a map reduce job, written scala for Apache Spark, 
designed to take the output from kafka 
in the Clojure news feed service and prepare it for the ETL job that 
loads an OLAP cube to analyze this performance data.

This is functionally equivalent to both the NewsFeedPerformance Java project 
and the perf cascalog project.
